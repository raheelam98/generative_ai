# Generative AI
Generative AI uses advanced machine learning models to create realistic text, images, and audio. It can generate content for various applications, such as writing, image design, and music production. By learning from large datasets, these models improve over time, helping automate creative tasks across industries.

### Framework
A framework is a structured foundation of tools and libraries that simplifies and accelerates software development.

A framework provides a structured foundation with predefined rules and patterns for building applications, where the developer typically follows its architecture (inversion of control).

### Open-source library
An open-source library is a collection of reusable code or functions that developers can freely use, integrate, or adapt within their own project without being bound by strict architectural rules.

## LangChain
LangChain is a framework designed to build applications powered by language models, enabling tasks like chatbots, question-answering, and document analysis. It simplifies workflows by integrating tools like APIs, vector databases, and memory for seamless interaction with large language models.

## LangGraph
LangGraph is an open-source library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling the creation of complex agent and multi-agent workflows. It offers fine-grained control over application flow and state, supporting features like memory persistence and human-in-the-loop interactions 

## Fine-tuning
Fine-tuning is the process of customizing a pre-trained machine learning model by training it on specific, smaller datasets to improve performance for a particular task. It allows the model to adapt its knowledge to domain-specific requirements while retaining its general capabilities.
